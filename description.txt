[h1][b][u]MooMoo's Ultimate Yoyo Revamp[/u][/b][/h1]
This mod changes most of the yoyo subclass, bringing new and exciting features to help spice up your gameplay!
From an overhauled yoyo bag system, to unique effects for previously mundane and boring vanilla yoyos, there is a lot more content to explore.

[h1][u][b]A quick summary of what the mod adds:[/b][/u][/h1]
[b]- New Yoyo Bag System -[/b]
Yoyo bags are no longer just a combination of a yoyo glove, string, and a counterweight. Instead, they allow the user to have access to new slots, allowing for greater customization while maintaining the idea of a yoyo bag.
[b]- New Skeleton Peddler NPC -[/b]
There is a new NPC called the "Skeleton Peddler" that will now sell all yoyo-related items. You can no longer obtain stuff such as the Code1, counterweights, etc. from other NPCs. His shop is very simple: after each boss (with some exceptions), he will sell more items. He has 2 different shops, one being a yoyo-only shop, and the other being an accessory shop. He will move in once you obtain a yoyo of any type, however it's possible some yoyos from other mods might not work, so try getting a wooden yoyo and holding onto it.
[b]- Unique Effects for Every Yoyo -[/b]
Every yoyo now has a unique effect that is either passively triggered, or requires a certain condition to be met. (Such as having a specific accessory equipped).
[b]- Lots of New Yoyos! -[/b]
This mod adds quite the catalog of new yoyos, aiming to allow you to have a good range of choices for the yoyos you want to use. From boss-themed yoyos, to "true" yoyos, you will never run out of choices for your playthrough.
[u][b]NOTES:[/b][/u]
[u]This mod is not entirely aimed to be 100% balanced.[/u] There are some things that either are too powerful, or not powerful enough. [b]This doesn't mean the game will become super easy, just that some parts could do with a little re balancing.[/b] It is still fairly early in development, meaning that there are more features to add, and bugs to fix.  A wiki is currently in development, however, due to me being the only wiki editor, it will not be a quick process.

Just a warning though, a lot of stuff stuff was written a long time ago, back when I was still very new to programming. I do plan on re-doing a lot of my code to make it better.
